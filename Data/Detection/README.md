This directory (Detection) contains data of simulations for the power to detect heterogeneity in susceptibility.

File names specify relevant parameters, such as the number of focal individuals (F), number of naive individuals (N), parameters dictating the underlying susceptibility distribution (p_A, p_B, f_A, k, theta), etc.

These data were used to generate detection plots for the method without modification (Figs 2 and 3 in the main text).
They were also used in supplementary plots to compare the method without modification to various considerations (e.g., the effect of false negatives).

Files with "N100" were used to generate Figs S1, S2, S3, and S4 in determining the effect of changing N.
